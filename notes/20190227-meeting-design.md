## Discussion

1. Ecosystem presentation March 12 — right after Grin’s governance meeting. We’ll usher who we can into Grin/ecosystem for the presentations. Ironbelly, Nijynot, Cypherpunk 42, SuperGrin, and possibly Superlinear Wallet and 713.
2. Noah Yeh has been busy organizing the ecosystem project showcase on March 12. The Chinese site for information about Grin is up!
3. Nijynot is working on the leaderboard/Hall of Fame for the Friends of Grin page.
4. Rosa is switching from Smirk to 713?
5. Christoph:

> After helping with the Ironbelly site the previous week, I started iterating on the design for https://713.mw in a Figma file Daniel had shared with me. Not trying to reinvent the wheel right now, just trying to make things look and feel a bit more professional.

6. Surprise drop in by Monkyyy! Thank you for dropping in, Monkyyy. We hope you’ll make it a habit.
7. MF_Grin is brainstorming with Numecca.
8. Numecca is picking at narrative design.
9. Ernest is on vacation until next week.

### Future plans

1. Noah will continue gathering content for the Chinese site. Prepare for the Ecosystem event: prep questions, coordinate with project teams, etc.
2. Nijynot will work on a GUI for grin wallets after the leaderboard is finished.
3. Christoph will continue working on 713.
4. Monkyyy will think a bit about the “end game” if one of these grand experiments were to ever go viral. What would be the effect of that? What does that world look like? What is the domino effect if people used “Better Money” as it relates to the endgame? As it relates to original intent you described.
5. Numecca will get in touch with Super Linear Wallet. Post an unfinished idea to the forum to kick-start narrative design using lore established at Grincon as the departure point. Expatiate upon the presentation experience. What would that look like if that was translated into open spaces in the real world as a guerrilla marketing vector?
