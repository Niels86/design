## Actions / Decisions / Events

1. Decided on using [mimblewimble/design](https://github.com/mimblewimble/design) for organizing work, tasks, etc.
2. Try making it easier to jump into the repo and help out, by e.g. adding issues, fixing README.md, or giving feedback/commenting on other's work.
3. PR is paused for now as there's no consensus on how to manage it. The next [governance meeting](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/issues/66) should clarify and answer most of our questions, and we'll continue from there.
